# Any Civitai FLUX.1 model — RunPod Serverless worker

A ready-to-build [RunPod Serverless](https://runpod.io?ref=qpguwapm) worker for **any FLUX.1 model on Civitai or Hugging Face** — FLUX.1 dev, schnell and Krea fine-tunes. You paste the model's Civitai or Hugging Face link into the `Dockerfile`; the build downloads that model and bakes it into the image. Based on the official [`runpod/worker-comfyui`](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-comfyui).

> Some Civitai models are 18+. You download them with your own Civitai account and are responsible for following each model's license.

## What it takes

- A **Checkpoint** whose base model is Flux.1 D, Flux.1 S or Flux.1 Krea. FLUX.2, Chroma, SDXL, video models, LoRAs and others are refused at build time with a clear message — they need a different workflow.
- The smallest SafeTensor file that plain ComfyUI loads (fp8 rather than fp16 — faster to build, fits a 24 GB GPU; NF4, NVFP4, INT8 and GGUF files are skipped), and only if its tensors are a FLUX.1 model's. It is checked by SHA-256 against Civitai and saved as `diffusion_models/model.safetensors`; `model.json` next to it records which model and version it is.
- On Hugging Face: a repo with a single-file model (a `.safetensors` of the whole FLUX.1 transformer at its top, like `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev`). Most are gated: they need `HF_TOKEN=<a Read token>` in `civitai.env` after you press **Agree** on the model's page. A full-size (fp16) file is loaded as fp8 by Cobalt Pear's workflow so it fits. Link a file (`…/blob/main/<file>`) to pick one.

The FLUX.1 text encoders (T5 fp8, CLIP-L) and VAE are downloaded too, pinned by SHA-256. LoRAs: see [LoRAs](#loras).

## Setup (about 10 minutes + build time)

New to this? Follow the [step-by-step setup guide](https://cobaltpear.github.io/guide.html).

1. **Make your own private copy** — click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository** → choose **Private**.
   (Your Civitai token will be in it, so it must stay private.)
2. **Fill in two lines** of `Dockerfile` in your copy (✏️ edit → Commit):
   - `PASTE_YOUR_CIVITAI_TOKEN_HERE` → your token (civitai.com → Account settings → Security & Apps → API Keys). Leave it for a Hugging Face model.
   - `PASTE_THE_MODEL_LINK_HERE` → the model's page link, e.g. `https://civitai.com/models/978314`. A link without `modelVersionId` takes the newest version; a plain version number works too. Or a Hugging Face link, e.g. `https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell`.

   Using [Cobalt Pear](https://cobaltpear.github.io/)? It gives you two links instead: one makes your private copy, the other opens a new file `civitai.env` with the model filled in — paste your token (none for a Hugging Face model), Commit. That file wins over the `Dockerfile` lines.

   No RunPod account yet? [Sign up here](https://runpod.io?ref=qpguwapm) — a referral link: after you first add $10, RunPod gives you a bonus credit (usually $5–10) and this repo a small credit.
3. **Create the endpoint** — see [Create the endpoint](#create-the-endpoint) below.
4. **Create an API key** — RunPod → Settings → API Keys → **Restricted**, allow only this endpoint.

One endpoint = one model. For another model, make another copy (or change the link and rebuild).

## Create the endpoint

RunPod → **Serverless** → **New Endpoint** → **Deploy from a GitHub repository** → pick your copy (the first time, **Edit connection** lets RunPod see it). Then, top to bottom on the page:

| Where on the page | What to set |
|---|---|
| **Endpoint name** | anything — your copy's name is fine |
| **GPU configuration** | tick a **24 GB** (or a bigger one) box (more boxes = easier to get a GPU) |
| **Max workers** | `1` |
| Click **Advanced settings** to open it: | |
| → **Active workers** | `0` — nothing to pay while idle |
| → **GPU count** | `1` |
| → **Idle timeout** | `5` sec |
| → **Enable FlashBoot** | on (the switch) · **Standard** |
| → **Enable execution timeout** | on · **Execution timeout** `600` sec |
| → click **Container configuration** to open it → **Container disk** | `40` GB |

Leave everything else as it is, then **Deploy** at the bottom. The first build takes about 25 minutes. The very first request after that waits another 3–10 minutes while a worker pulls the image; later cold starts are much faster.

## Updates

Your copy only holds the token and the link. The build steps (`build.sh`, `handler.py`) are downloaded from this repo on every build, so fixes here reach you when you rebuild.

To rebuild: commit any change to the `main` branch of your copy — RunPod builds again on every push to `main` (the endpoint's **Builds** tab shows it). Nothing to change? Edit `README.md` (✏️), add a line, **Commit changes…** → **Commit changes**.

## Use it

Any client that sends ComfyUI API-format workflows to RunPod works. `pack.json` in this repo holds a plain FLUX.1 workflow (DPM++ 2M, sgm_uniform, 20 steps, Flux guidance 3.5; a schnell model wants 4 steps) and tells a client where the prompt, seed and size go (format `pack/1`, engine `comfyui`).

Raw request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<ENDPOINT_ID>/runsync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"input\": {\"workflow\": $(jq .workflow pack.json | jq '.["6"].inputs.text = "a girl reading a book in a cafe" | .["25"].inputs.noise_seed = 1')}}"
```

The image comes back as base64 in `output.images[0].data`.

Each model has its own best settings — see its Civitai page (sampler, steps, Flux guidance, trigger words).

### LoRAs

- **Per picture:** send up to 4 LoRAs with a request: `input.remote_loras` = `[{"name": "remote_<id>.safetensors", "url": "<download link>", "sha256": "<file sha256>"}]` plus a `LoraLoader` reading that name in the workflow — the worker downloads each once and keeps it while it runs. [Cobalt Pear](https://cobaltpear.github.io/) does all of this from a Civitai or Hugging Face link. For more than 4, set the environment variable `REMOTE_LORA_MAX` (e.g. `8`) on your endpoint (**Manage → Edit Endpoint → Environment Variables**).
- **Built in:** put links in the `LORAS` line of your `Dockerfile` — each followed by its strength — and rebuild. They are downloaded once at build time, so a fresh worker doesn't download them again. A request picks which ones it uses with `input.baked_loras` = `[{"link": "<link from LORAS>", "strength": 0.8}]` (`[]` = none); without it every one is used at its `LORAS` strength. One that isn't built in (yet) is left out and named in `output.warning`, and `output.built_in` lists the built-in LoRAs. Put their trigger words in your prompt yourself. To accept only built-in LoRAs, set `REMOTE_LORA_MAX` to `0`.
- Pick LoRAs made for FLUX.1 — the worker warns (`output.warning`) when one doesn't fit.

### Compatible clients

- [Cobalt Pear](https://cobaltpear.github.io/) — a one-page web app. Paste the same Civitai link under **Models → Custom**: it reads the creator's settings from Civitai and sets steps, Flux guidance and sampler for that model. Everything stays in your browser. [Try the demo](https://cobaltpear.github.io/demo/) without RunPod.
